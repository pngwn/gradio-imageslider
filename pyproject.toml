description = """
A Gradio component for comparing two images.

This component can be used in several ways:

- as a **unified input / output** where users will upload a single image and an inference function will generate an image it can be compared to (see demo),
- as a **manual upload input** allowing users to compare two of their own images (which can then be passed along elsewhere, e.g. to a model), 
- as **static output component** allowing users to compare two images generated by an inference function.
